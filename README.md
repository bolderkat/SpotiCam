Turn your photos into music.

SpotiCam is a camera-based experience that calculates the dominant color in a photo and uses the color to fetch track recommendations from Spotify's Web API.

Through working on SpotiCam, I developed the following skills:

* Writing an app in 100% Objective-C
* Use of AVCaptureSession
* Use of Core Image/Core Graphics
* REST API queries and JSON Parsing
* OAuth token management with AppAuth and Keychain
* StoreKit, in-app purchases
* App Store review and release process

SpotiCam is [available now on the App Store.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spoticam/id1556162433)
