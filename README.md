Turn your photos into music.

SpotiCam is a camera-based experience that calculates the dominant color in a photo and uses the color to fetch music recommendations from Spotify's Web API. Once the track recommendations are on hand, users can easily create their newest Spotify playlist right from the app.

Through working on SpotiCam, I developed the following skills:

* App Store review and release process
* Writing an app in 100% Objective-C
* Use of AVCaptureSession
* Use of Core Image/Core Graphics
* REST API queries and JSON Parsing
* OAuth token management with AppAuth and Keychain
* StoreKit, in-app purchases

SpotiCam is [available now on the App Store.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spoticam/id1556162433)
