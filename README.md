Turn your photos into music.

SpotiCam is a camera-based experience that calculates the dominant color in a photo and uses the color to fetch track recommendations from Spotify's Web API.

Through working on SpotiCam, I developed the following skills:

* Objective-C
* Familiarity with AVCaptureSession
* Familiarity Core Image/Core Graphics
* REST API queries and JSON Parsing

SpotiCam is nearly ready for App Store release, and it will also feature StoreKit integration for tip jar in-app purchases.
